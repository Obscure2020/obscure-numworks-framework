# Image Processing

Hello! Welcome to the corner of the project where we pre-process bitmap image data for packaging into the app. The `ImgProc.java` program present in this folder is what Joey wrote and used to produce `sprites.h`.

He ran it by executing this command in the terminal:
```
clear && javac *.java && java ImgProc electrode.png onix.png pikachu.png
```
